# EV Adoption Forecasting ðŸš—âš¡

As electric vehicle (EV) adoption surges, urban planners must anticipate infrastructure needsâ€”particularly the deployment of EV charging stations. Poorly planned infrastructure can result in bottlenecks, reduced user satisfaction, and slower progress toward sustainability goals.

## ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement

Using the electric vehicle dataset, which includes information on EV populations, vehicle types, and historical registration data, this project aims to develop a regression model to forecast future EV adoption. For instance, the model should predict the number of electric vehicles expected in upcoming years based on historical trends.

## ðŸŽ¯ Goal

Build a regression-based forecasting model that accurately predicts future EV adoption trends using factors like:

- Historical EV growth patterns
- Vehicle types (BEVs, PHEVs, etc.)
- Regional and county-level data

The model should assist policymakers and planners in making data-driven infrastructure decisions.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset Overview

The dataset represents monthly vehicle registration counts maintained by the Washington State Department of Licensing (DOL), spanning from **January 2017 to February 2024**.

**Key Attributes:**
- `Date`: Month-end timestamp of registration (e.g., 2017-01-31 to 2024-02-29)
- `County`: Washington State county where the vehicle is registered
- `State`: Geographical location associated with the vehicle record
- `Vehicle Primary Use`: Describes usage typeâ€”Passenger (83%) or Truck (17%)
- `Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs)`: Vehicles powered solely by onboard batteries
- `Plug-In Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs)`: Vehicles partially powered by onboard batteries
- `Electric Vehicle (EV) Total`: Total of BEVs + PHEVs
- `Non-Electric Vehicle Total`: All non-electric vehicle registrations
- `Total Vehicles`: Total number of all vehicle registrations in the county
- `Percent Electric Vehicles`: Percentage of EVs compared to non-EVs

## ðŸ§  Technologies & Tools (planned)

- Python (pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib/seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab
- Regression Algorithms (Linear Regression, Random Forest, etc.)
- Time Series Analysis (optional, depending on modeling approach)
- Data Visualization Tools

## ðŸš€ Expected Outcome

A robust regression model capable of forecasting:
- The number of electric vehicles in the near future (e.g., 2025, 2026â€¦)
- EV adoption rates by region (county-wise)
- Insights into trends by vehicle type (BEV vs PHEV)

This model will serve as a valuable tool for smart city planning and EV infrastructure optimization.
